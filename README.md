*UPDATE*
Many people asked me about the scripts I used to generate MIST-Modified JSON. So here there are ! (take a look to scripts section).
You might use `mist_json.py`  as a reporting module from CuckooSandbox and the script `fromMongoToARFF.py` to generate ARFF files suitables for WEKA.

If you are going to create new datasets by running your local CuckooSandbox using `mist_json.py` module and you wanto to share them, please feel free to make pool requests !
